 The United States Pirate Party **(USPP)** is an American political party founded in 2006 by Brent Allison and Alex English.
  The party's platform is aligned with the global Pirate movement, and supports reform of copyright laws to reflect open source and free culture values, government transparency, protection of privacy and civil liberties.  
   The United States Pirate Party also advocates for evidence-based policy, egalitarianism, meritocracy and the hacker ethic as well as the rolling back of corporate personhood and corporate welfare.  
    The USPP has also made a priority to advocate for changes in the copyright laws and removal of patents.   
   It is the belief of the party that these restrictions greatly hinder the sharing and expansion of knowledge and resources.
